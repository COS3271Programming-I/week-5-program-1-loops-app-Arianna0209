The code in the Loops App runs a for statement that iterates for each value of i until i reaches 5000, and each time the for loop iterates it prints a statement telling the user i’s current value. After each iteration the program increases the value of i by multiplying it by two and adding one. Then the program will test the new value of i to ensure that it is still less than 5000, and if so it will run the for loop again and add to the value of i again. It will continue this loop until i reaches or surpasses the target value.
